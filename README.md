# CNN Active Learning
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rafutek/CNN-active-learning.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rafutek/CNN-active-learning)

University project where we had to implement **3 active learning methods**: uncertainty sampling, tree of space versions, and reduction of the model generalization error.

As our course was about advanced neural networks, we chose to implement relatively known **convolutional neural networks (CNN)**. Wich are VGGnet, ResNeXt and SENet.

We needed also some data to process, so we took **2 image datasets**, CIFAR10 and imageNet, and **1 audio dataset**, audioSet.

This study is done in **Python** with **pyTorch** library.

Please, take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/rafutek/CNN-active-learning/wiki) for more details.

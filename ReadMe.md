# CNN Active Learning

University project where we had to implement 3 active learning methods: uncertainty sampling, tree of space versions, and reduction of the model generalization error.

As our course was about advanced neural networks, we chose to implement relatively known convolutional neural networks (CNN). Wich are VGGnet, ResNeXt and SENet.

We needed also some data to process, so we took 2 image datasets, CIFAR10 and imageNet, and an audio dataset, audioSet.

This study is done in Python with pyTorch library.
